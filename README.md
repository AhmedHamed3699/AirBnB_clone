# ðŸ”— AirBnB Clone

This is a clone to the famous website AirBnB, made as a project for ALX SE program.  
It is a full web application that consists of:  
- command interpreter
- HTML/CSS templating
- database storage
- API
- front-end integration

## âš™  Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Python
- Flask
- MySQL

## âŒ¨  Command Interpreter

It is a shell but limited to a specific use-case.  
We use it mainly for the sake of debugging and testing the objects of our project:  
- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etcâ€¦
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etcâ€¦)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

### How To Use It

If you want to deal with it in interactive mode, run:

```bash
./console.py
```

But if you want it in non-interactive mode, you can do it like this:

```bash
echo "help" | ./console.py
```

**Note**: You can always type `help`  
if you want to know the documented commands or how to use any of them
